## Custom functions and libraries

- I2C URM09 Ultrasonic Sensor code, converted to CrcLib (/tests/i2c_ultrasonic.cpp)
- wait(), waitfast(), and recreated pulseIn() (/tests/converted_arduino_functions.cpp), to be used for HC_SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor

- StandardLib, global library to encompass all of these new functions (yet to be developed)
