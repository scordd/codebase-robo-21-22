### CRC Arcanum 2021 - 2022 Codebase
Welcome to this year's codebase for the CRC Arcanum 2021-2022 games.
Last year's code was messy, unorganized, and generally crappy. We're making some improvements this year, notably:
- Making the switch from the incomplete Arduino IDE to PlatformIO
- Implementing Git and Github CLI into our workflows
- We've also acquired 3 new Linux systems to aid in the development of the robot

This year, we are implementing the XBee module framework to the codebase, notably;
- The code for the controller and receiver
- The removal of automation from last year

>  This code is specific to the CRCduino and **WILL NOT** work with any other Arduino.

**More to come soon.**
